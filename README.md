# Introduction to Programming - Engineering Studies

This repository contains a collection of programming exercises from the "Introduction to Programming" course, which is part of my engineering degree program.
The exercises are intended to develop basic programming skills using the C\C++ programming language.

## Exercises

The repository includes solutions to various exercises, including but not limited to:

- Working with loops, conditions, and basic input/output
- Array manipulations
- Random number generation and simulations
- Algorithms for solving basic computational problems
- String manipulation and validation
- Mathematical computations and logical problem-solving

### List of Key Exercises

1. **Basic Loops and Conditionals** - Programs using loops to solve basic problems like finding divisors, generating sequences, etc.
2. **Arrays and Sorting** - Programs that manipulate arrays, including sorting and modifying elements based on conditions.
3. **Random Number Simulations** - Programs that involve random number generation.
4. **Basic Algorithms** - Implementation of algorithms for simple mathematical tasks and problem-solving.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dormej/introduction-to-programming.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the repository directory:
    ```bash
    cd introduction-to-programming
    ```
3. Open any `.c` \ `.cpp` file in your preferred text editor and compile it using a C\C++ compiler:
    ```bash
    gcc filename.c -o filename
    ./filename
    ```

   ```bash
    gcc filename.cpp -o filename
    ./filename
    ```
